//  CUSpriteMeshLoader.h
//  Cornell University Game Library (CUGL)
//
//  This module provides a specific implementation of the Loader class to load
//  sprite meshes. A sprite mesh has its own backing graphics buffer. Hence,
//  like a texture, it should be loaded once and reused as necessary. Note that
//  this is one of the reasons sprite meshes do not have fixed textures -- so
//  that they can be reused.
//
//  As with all of our loaders, this loader is designed to be attached to an
//  asset manager.  In addition, this class uses our standard shared-pointer
//  architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.
