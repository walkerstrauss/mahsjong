/**
 * This class represents the configuration for our underlying Netcode. 
 * 
 * Each {@link NetcodeConnection} has a configuration that cannot be changed 
 * once connection is established. This configuration controls such things as
 * the initial lobby server (what the game connects to find other players), the
 * ICE servers (used for NAT traversal), and communication settings like the
 * MTU (maximum transmission unit). All all of these, only the lobby is required.
 * Provided that the lobby is on the same network as the players, the default
 * values for all of the other settings are sufficient.
 *
 * The lobby MUST be the address of a websocket running the CUGL game lobby. 
 * While our netcode uses standard Web RTC signaling protocols, a generic 
 * signaling server will not give us the room management that we need.
 *
 * When specifying ICE servers, the standard setup is to either specify a STUN 
 * and a TURN server, or a STUN server only. Specifying no ICE servers mean
 * that only local connections are supported.
 *
 * This class is effectively a simple struct. All attributes are publicly 
 * available and we do not use the standard CUGL shared pointer architecture.
 * Internet addresses are designed to be use on the stack, though you can
 * combine them with shared pointers Ã¥if you wish.
