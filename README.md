### 607 Games: Walker Strauss, Patrick Choo, Keqing Jiang, Luna Lu, Tian Jin, Tina Lu, Aiden Keck, Mariia Tiulchenko, Alexander Balako

### Goal:
This is a 1v1 strategic card game. The goal of the game is to build a full of mahjong hand before your opponent does; a full mahjong hand is defined as 4 sets of three and a pair. A set of three can consist of either a 3 of a kind or a straight, both of which most be the same suit. At the beginning of each turn, you have one of two actions: draw from the pile or draw from the discard. When you draw from the pile or the discard, you must discard a card fromn your hand in order to end your turn. In order to draw from the discard, you must be able to play a set of three with the card you drew from discard. If you are able to do so, you must "reveal" that set, and that set becomes permanent in your hand (meaning you cannot discard or use any tiles from that set to make other sets). In the future, we aim to include command tiles where they force you to take perform an actions, and action tiles where you can play at activate a powerup. 

In order to play with another player, please have one player host and the second player enter the code that the host receives.
