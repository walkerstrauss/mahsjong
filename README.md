### About the Game:
#### Goal
This is a 1v1 strategic card game. The goal of the game is to build a full of mahjong hand before your opponent does; a full mahjong hand is defined as 4 sets of three and a pair. A set of three can consist of either a 3 of a kind or a straight, both of which most be the same suit. At the beginning of each turn, you have one of two actions: draw from the pile or draw from the discard. When you draw from the pile or the discard, you must discard a card fromn your hand in order to end your turn. In order to draw from the discard, you must be able to play a set of three with the card you drew from discard. If you are able to do so, you must "reveal" that set, and that set becomes permanent in your hand (meaning you cannot discard or use any tiles from that set to make other sets).

#### Celestial Tiles
The game also includes Celestial tiles, which appear in the tile and can be played to boost players chances or disrupt their opponent's strategy. The Celestial tiles include: <br>
- Rooster tile: shuffles the tiles in the current pile layer <br>
- Ox tile: debuffs two tiles in the opponent's hand (debuff = no sets or winning hand with this tile) <br>
- Rabbit tile: changes the rank of a random tile in the opponent's hand <br>
- Snake tile: changes the suit of a random tile in the opponent's hand <br>
- Monkey tile: trade one of your tiles for a random tile in the opponent's hand <br>
- Rat tile: choose one tile to draw from the face up pile tiles <br>
- Dragon tile: rearrange a row of your choice in the pile <br>
- Pig tile: draw any tile in the discard pile to your hand
